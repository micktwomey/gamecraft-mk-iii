    "content": "# GameCraft is Back in London!\r\n\r\nHave a passion for game development? Think you've got the skills to create a game in a single day? Then don't miss the 2nd annual London GameCraft!\r\n\r\nLondon GameCraft is a game jam event where folks come together to make games! Teams (or brave individuals,) get together and are given a theme early in the morning and from there have as little as 8 hours (sometimes 12 if we\u2019re feeling generous). Games are built from scratch on any platform you like, at the end of the day the games are demoed by a panel of judges who award prizes for the best contenders. It\u2019s a great chance to flex your creative muscles, tackle some quick and dirty coding problems, and to get out there and meet other game-makers face to face.\r\n\r\nYou have 12 hours from then to make a game, followed by networking and play-testing (by the judges and your peers) and at the end winners are announced. We will provide all meals (including a beer & pizza reception in the evening) and refreshments throughout the day. Please bring your own laptop and power leads (you always need them).\r\n\r\n## Register here: [https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6244-london-gamecraft-2014](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6244-london-gamecraft-2014)\r\n\r\n# About Skills Matter\r\nSkills Matter\u2019s mission is to promote continuous learning and innovation in software.

I would profess to being a seasoned gamer with (un)fond memories of EGA graphics and 64kb RAM being \u201ctop of the range\u201d and blowing furiously into C64 cartridges in an attempt to prolong their gaming life. Outside of gaming I enjoy music, films and having my heart broken every season by Arsenal.\r\n\r\n## Dave McCabe\r\n\r\nDave McCabe is a film director, writer and script editor who has worked on more things than he\u2019d care to remember. He is currently studying an MSc in Film wherein his speciality is story and character development. The first video game he played was a version of \u2018Green Beret\u2019 that was so old he can\u2019t even find a copy on youtube\u2026\r\n\r\nOnline, he lives at davetheallthing.com.\r\n\r\n## Eoin Meagher\r\n\r\nEoin started off his gaming obsession with the mighty plastic grey box that was the Commodore 64. Years of torment from insanely difficult gaming lead him to the PC generation and he fell in love with games all over again. Having worked in GAME and computer hardware centers he went back to college to Carlow IT and got a degree in a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Games Development. Now a big fan of Unity3d he champions the indy cause, esp the IrishGameDev scene and will gladly talk for hours and hours about games, to any person who\u2019s not abe to escape\u2026. you have been warned!\r\n\r\n## Joseph Kehoe\r\n\r\nThe first computer games Joseph Kehoe played were on a Dragon 32 but that was in the previous millennium. He graduated from UCD with a BSc (Computer Science in 1990 and an MSc (AI) in 1993. Since then he have worked mainly in Education teaching at all levels from Certificate to MSc. He has worked in industry for a number of years but prefers the ivory tower that is education. Currently he lectures Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (amongst other things) in IT Carlow on the Computer Games Development BSc. In his spare time he is interested in scripting languages and parallel programming. Rumour has it that he is actually a cyborg and talks about himself in the third person.\r\n\r\n## Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby Biog\r\n\r\nThe Gaming Liberty is an award winning founded by Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby in 2009. Two avid and enthusiastic gamers, they quickly established The Gaming Liberty as a credible, friendly and up-to-date gaming website.

Then (at least) one of you team should be on hand to problem-solve and guide the judges as we go around individually and play them. We hope to get to all your games, but will endeavour to get at least three of us to play every game.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll judge your game on the criteria listed below, score it out of 50 and then reconvene to discuss and average our scores to give your game its final result.\r\n\r\nWe aim to have this done by 11pm, when we will announce the top three games and any honourable mentions before giving out prizes and whatnot.\r\n\r\nJudges notes and game scores will not be released.\r\n\r\n### CRITERIA\r\n\r\nYour game will be judged on the following criteria:\r\n\r\n- Gameplay (mechanics, design, etc)\r\n- Art (graphics, audio)\r\n- Technology (programming, platforms, technical innovation)\r\n- Idea (a measure of how well you implement the theme, story, that kinda stuff)\r\n- How complete the game you make is (a fully functional game and polish such as menus, start screens, cut-scenes, etc )",

On the 17th of May 2014, DIT will be hosting three special GameCraft events\r\n\r\n* A right proper 24 hour GameCraft.\r\n* An 8 hour Unplugged GameCraft\r\n* And a special Coder Dojo GameCraft for awesome younger folk aged 13 to 18\r\n\r\nWe hope you\u2019ll be able to join us there to celebrate in true, sleep deprived, game developer fashion.\r\n\r\n<!-- <div style=\"width: 100%; text-align: left;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/tickets-external?eid=11313038603&amp;ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"5\" marginheight=\"5\" scrolling=\"auto\" width=\"100%\" height=\"440\"></iframe></div> -->\r\n\r\n### [UPDATE] There is **NO** requirement for a parent to attend and stay throughout the course of the event.\r\nCoder Dojo GameCraft If you are over 13 and under 18 then sign up for the Coder Dojo GameCraft\r\n<!--<div style=\"width: 100%; text-align: left;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/tickets-external?eid=11198762801&amp;ref=etckt\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"5\" marginheight=\"5\" scrolling=\"auto\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe></div>-->\r\n\r\n## This is how we roll:\r\n\r\n* Registration 11.30 am (you need to be at DIT Aungier street then)\r\n* Theme announced at 12noon, start making your game this is for all jams\r\n* **WE** encourage people to work in teams. It tends to be a better experience for everyone. If you need help forming a team, comment on this post or let us know on the day and we will help you find people to work with\r\n* Digital game jam\r\n    * You can use any framework, library platform you want as long as it is playable at the end of the jam\r\n    * You bring your own tools (laptop, tablet, whatever, extension leads)\r\n* Non-digital game jam (UnPlugged) \u2013 What to bring?\r\n    * That depends on what you\u2019re gonna make \u2013 we won\u2019t be able to provide all the fiddly little bits you need to make your game, so if you\u2019ll be making a board game, take along the components you\u2019ll need \u2013 card, tape, dice, avatars, etc.  With that in mind, you\u2019ll probably want to take a bit of time and figure out what one or two types of games you reckon you\u2019d like to make, so that you can prepare your toolbox in advance.\r\n* Judges vote .. there are prizes yay! And there is also a people\u2019s choice\r\n* Everyone learns\r\n* People meet other people\r\n* At 12 noon on Sunday the making of games stops and we start judging (we ll tell you exactly how the judging works on the day, pretty sure you are going to enjoy all the games)\r\n* At 2pm we start packing out and head to a pub (we'll announce where soon)\r\n\r\nA shout out to our host, [DIT](http://dit.ie), for venue and food.\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/scott-wilson/38/a96/478)\r\n",

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for Belfast GameCraft! This time around, particpants, either individually or as a team, have a whole 8 hours to create a game centered around a random theme to be announced on the day.\r\n\r\nIt will be exciting, it will be intense, it will be\u2026slightly pungent, frankly. But it will be worth it! After 8 hours, a panel of highly trained judges (at least, they look highly trained, they are all wearing monacles) will examine each of the submitted games and select a few stand out entries to be awarded some awesome prizes. While the games are being pinched, prodded, and poked, we\u2019ll all have some well deserved refreshments and a bit of time for the all important networking. Participants are free to use whatever game creation platform they like, be that Unity, UDK, GameMaker, Construct2, XNA, or one of the myriad other fine platforms available today. Good luck and may the most ridiculous game win!\r\n\r\n# What happens on the day?\r\n\r\n* You with your team need to build a game from scratch, you have about 8 hours.\r\n* You can come with a team formed or form your team there\r\n* Platform agnostic\r\n* We announce a topic during breakfast\r\n* Early start, then, at 5pm judging starts. There is a people\u2019s choice so we all get to play each others games\r\n* People and Judges vote .. there are prizes yay!\r\n* Everyone learns\r\n* People meet other people\r\n\r\nThis event is free but all members of your team need a ticket.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n### Q. Any restrictions on who can join?\r\nAll levels welcome.\r\n\r\n### Q: How many people can be in a team?\r\nTeam size is unrestricted, although bear in mind that larger teams will make it hard work as well.\r\n\r\n### Q: Do we bring our own hardware?\r\nYes, participants will bring their own hardware, but you will need to look after your own hardware on the day.\r\n\r\n### Q. Does GameCraft support online participation?\r\nNo, but we will look into it for future Dublin Game Crafts.\r\n\r\n### Q. Do we decide on an idea before the event?\r\nThe topic of the game is decided on the day, so probably not a good idea.\r\n\r\n### Q. Can we also bring pre-written frameworks we code ourselves. Would we need to share these frameworks with the other teams?\r\nYou are free to use which ever framework you want. Sharing your own framework is up to you.\r\n\r\n### Q. What other tools and frameworks should bring along?\r\nPrepare your machine with the tools before you come along on the day, this will alleviate the load on the wifi.

For any who don\u2019t know, in a game jam, you create a small game in a limited amount of time, either on your own or as a team. You can use whatever platform/tools/ gamedev voodoo you like, and it will be held in a place called [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com/) In Barrow Street, Dublin 2 ([Map](http://goo.gl/maps/O58P1)). Show up before 9am to get yourself set up, and at 9am on the dot, we\u2019ll announce the theme, followed by an explosive outpouring of creative energies for a solid twelve hours! Afterwards, our panel of specially trained minion judges will poke at your game for a few hours, and then declare themselves winners! This of course is not the desired outcome, so we\u2019ll get them to pick the best games to receive a few prizes instead. During this time, it\u2019s important that you be merry, drink some beers, and network with your fellow game devs.\r\n\r\n#TICKETS\r\n### Why are we charging for Dublin GameCraft?\r\nThis allows us to try and minimize the number of people ordering tickets and not turning up or turning up without ordering tickets.

We will follow up with more information which will include signing an NDA on the day.\r\n\r\n** NOTE: Proficiency in Javascript is recommended. **\r\n\r\n## What do I need if I am interested in making a game on NWF?\r\n\r\n* 2 GHz Core2Duo-class CPU or better\r\n* 4 GB of RAM\r\n* Microsoft Windows 7 64 bit\r\n* An ADMINISTRATOR account from which to install and use Nintendo Web Framework PC launcher is required.\r\n* At least one gigabit Ethernet port.\r\n* Slower Ethernet interfaces are not supported.\r\n\r\n## Can I use other technologies?\r\n\r\nOf course!

Now I\u2019m responsible for expanding <a title=\"Lionhead Studios\" href=\"http://lionhead.com/\">Lionhead</a> beyond our huge Fable franchise and opening a new door of opportunity, getting excited about new talent and new ideas!

More recently David developed <a title=\"Gateways\" href=\"http://www.smudgedcat.com/gateways.htm\">Gateways</a> which Game Informer gave 9/10 and listed as one of their top 50 games of 2012. <a title=\"Gateways\" href=\"http://www.smudgedcat.com/gateways.htm\">Gateways</a> was also one of the winning entries in Microsoft\u2019s 2012 <a title=\"Microsoft's Dream Build Play\" href=\"http://www.dreambuildplay.com/\">Dream Build Play</a> competition and received an honorable mention in the technical excellence category of the 2013 <a title=\"Indie Game Festival\" href=\"http://igf.com/\">IGF</a> competition. <a title=\"Smudged Cat Games\" href=\"http://www.smudgedcat.com/\">http://www.smudgedcat.com</a>\u00a0/ <a title=\"&quot;The voice of David Johnston&quot; on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/SmudgedCat\">@SmudgedCat</a>\r\n<h2>Gorm Lai</h2>\r\n<div>Gorm Lai is a\u00a0co-founder of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://nordicgamejam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nordic Game Jam</a>, which was the World's largest site jam for 3 years, as well as a co-founder of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://globalgamejam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Game Jam</a>.

You know, we here at the Gamecraft organisational hive mind have been thinking recently that, with all the fancy digital tom foolery and electronic doohickeys going on in game development these days, we\u2019ve lost touch with what it\u2019s like to do some pure game design. You know how PopPop used to make games? Little bits of paper. And a stick! And sometimes he\u2019d get so involved in what he was doing that he\u2019d wander off and we\u2019d find him standing in the neighbours paddling pool. Without his clothes on. Ah PopPop!\r\n\r\nSo with Gamecraft Unplugged, we\u2019re going to try something different. Leave your Three Dimensional Studio Maximum, your fancy text editors, and your noise machines at home, and come along with just your mind and some pen and paper. And maybe a stick if you\u2019re so inclined. Some dice might also be useful. The rules are simple. We\u2019ll announce a theme, as per usual Gamecrafts, and you\u2019ll then have 6 hours to design a board game, a card game, a pure numbers game, anything you like really, so long as it doesn\u2019t require electricity to run it.\r\n\r\nSimilar to previous GameCrafts, a theme will be announced at the beginning, form teams, make games, panic, rush to finish the game\u2026 and BOOM! It\u2019s the play and judging part of the jam.",

So stay tuned by following us on [@globalgamecraft.](https://twitter.com/globalgamecraft.)\r\n\r\nOne of us, Andrea Magnorsky, will be in New York on October 4th, if you want to meet up with her and other indies for a get together, drop us an email.\r\n\r\nIf you want to help us out and get involved with the next GameCraft, and make this one of our biggest and most memorable game jam outside of Ireland, email us at <a href=\"mailto://globalgamecraft@gmail.com\">globalgamecraft@gmail.com</a>.\r\n\r\n# END OF ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<br><br>\r\n# Hello game developers of New York.\r\n\r\nThis is an urgent game development community announcement. As you may be aware, Transformers 4 was recently released in cinemas. People who have come in contact with this movie have since reported suffering from a crippling lack of creativity. Symptoms may include:\r\n\r\n- the repeated and dull use of slow motion explosions and CG in everything they do\r\n- the desire to repeatedly and inexplicably shout the words No, Go, and Get out of here! in all lines of dialogue\r\n- an overt-yet-somehow-overlooked morally irresponsible treatment of the female anatomy\r\n\r\nIf you have been subjected to this creative black hole, then we urge you to come and attend the second New York GameCraft in [when], and reconnect with your creativity :)\r\n\r\n## If you've not been to a GameCraft event before, here's the blurb\r\n\r\nGameCraft is a game jam event designed around building the gaming community. We aim to create events which allow game-makers to meet, share ideas, have fun, compete for prizes and most importantly make games!\r\n\r\nThis is how we roll:\r\n\r\n- Registration is at **8.45 am** (you need to be at Game Center by that time)\r\n- Theme announced at **9am**, start making your game\r\n- We encourage people to work in teams. It tends to be a better experience for everyone. If you need help forming a team, comment on this post or let us know on the day and we will help you find people to work with\r\n- You can use any framework/library/platform you want\r\n- Bring your own tools (laptop, tablet, whatever, extension leads)\r\n- At **7pm**, you stop developing your games and go and play other peoples games.\r\n- Voting time! Pick your favourite game and vote for them\r\n- Awesome prize giving\r\n- We leave to have a drink at **9pm**\r\n\r\nThis is a free event but we need you to register for the event, please follow **[this link for registration](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6403-gamecraft-nyc-2014)**\r\n\r\n## Address\r\n\r\n\r\nGame Center, \r\n2 Metrotech Center \r\n8th Floor \r\nBrooklyn, NY 11201 \r\n[map](https://goo.gl/maps/umfyT)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you all there :) \r\n\r\n# Thanks\r\nThis event coult not happen without the help from Game Center (thanks Eric for all the intros) and SkillsMatter.\r\n\r\n![NYU Game Center](http://www.indiecade.com/images/sponsor-logos/2012/nyu_game_center_2013.png) \r\n\r\n![SkillsMatter](https://d2rrjv931ezem9.cloudfront.net/assets/logo_proper-ab007777596e0181328daf7e1bc921c1.png)",

What games can I make?\r\nAnything from card games to board games to street games and other types of [pervasive games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervasive_game).\r\n\r\n### Q. Do I need to be in a team?\r\nIf you are not in a team on the day, we will try and group people together on the day.",

Teams (or brave individuals,) get together and are given a theme early in the morning and from there have as little as 8 hours (sometimes 12 if we\u2019re feeling generous). Games are built from scratch on any platform you like, at the end of the day the games are demoed by a panel of judges who award prizes for the best contenders. It\u2019s a great chance to flex your creative muscles, tackle some quick and dirty coding problems, and to get out there and meet other game-makers face to face.\r\n> \r\n> You have 12 hours from then to make a game, followed by networking and play-testing (by the judges and your peers) and at the end winners are announced. We will provide all meals (including a beer & pizza reception in the evening) and refreshments throughout the day. Please bring your own laptop and power leads (you always need them).\r\n\r\n## [REGISTRATION](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6610-london-gamecraft-2014-part-deux) \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you can email us (Andrea/Vicky) at <a href=\"mailto:info@gamecraft.it\">info@gamecraft.it</a>.\r\n\r\n## BREAKDOWN OF THE DAY\r\n\r\n* **08:30** Registration and Welcome with Coffee, Tea and Pastries\r\n* **09:00** Theme Announced - Get building!\r\n* **13:00** Lunch & Refreshments\r\n* **20:00** Voting begins (with some pizza & drinks)\r\n* **22:00** Prizes + To The Pub\r\n\r\n# ABOUT SKILLS MATTER\r\nSkills Matter\u2019s mission is to promote continuous learning and innovation in software. More than 35,000 people get together at Skills Matter each year, everyone with the goal of improving themselves and our community.

    "content": "When I first heard from a friend about his experience with Gamecraft and his first gamejam I was intrigued. I graduated from games development but had not put those skills to use in quite some time. The thought of sitting down and programming a game for 24 hours with my rusty skills honestly made me nervous. However I was also very curious as my friend spoke at length on what a wonderful and fun experience he had. I decided to look up the website and see when the next one was on. Maybe I would be able to get enough practice in to actually be of use to a team. However when I read the site I found out about the Unplugged category! The aim was to design a non digital game and I knew instantly that this was how I wanted to spend 7 hours of my Saturday. I convinced a group of friends (some of whom were very, very big board games fans), got out all of my art supplies and off we went!\r\n\r\nOnce we arrived in DIT we all got out our equipment (with some interested looks from the lovely people who were torturing themselves in the name of fun with the 24 digital gamejam) and started planning. The amazing organisers had lots of very tasty food to keep us all fuelled and even a cake! We met our friendly competition, finished our game (with some very crudely drawn artwork as well) and recruited some playtesters. This was a difficult challenge as the digital games people were very hard at work and while wandering around the room trying to find potential victims I got to see some of the amazing work the digital crowd were getting up to. The atmosphere was very friendly and we got a few lovely people willing to give the game a go. \r\n\r\nBefore getting to playtest the other teams games it was time for some delicious pizza. There was even lots of vegetarian pizza. I was very impressed! The best part of the day was when all the games were finished and we got to playtest the other teams work. The amount of effort that had gone into the games was amazing and it was really wonderful to see how the other teams worked with the theme. Sadly I only got to playtest one of the other teams games rather then both of them. Don't Say was a really wonderful and fun party game. It have everyone in bits laughing at our terrible drawings and was a really enjoyable game to play. The whole experience was really fun and I made a number of new friends during our day of gamecrafting. I am positive I'll be attending more in the future (and may even turn my hand at the full 24 hour digital game marathon next time!) and I enjoyed every minute of the day!\r\n\r\nSophie's Blog: [glitternotgold.wordpress.com](http://glitternotgold.wordpress.com)",

    "content": "Game jams are awesome! New people, new ideas, new ways of doing stuff! If you\u2019ve never been to one you are in for a surprise and a great time! The upcoming Dublin Gamecraft in February is an 8 hour affair that will see individuals and teams come together in one room to create something new and unseen. It will also lead to new friendships and more connections in our little indie game dev scene.\r\n\r\nHowever, not to put a damper on the idea and enthusiasm but game jams are still work, in a way. The day is great for meeting people, chatting and shooting the breeze but if you want to have a game done by the end of the day you gotta knuckle down and go for it. To keep this post on topic and away from the ramblings of a mad man I\u2019m going to condense it down to a more manageable bullet point style of Do/Don\u2019t/Thoughts to get you through the day. There\u2019s are just my personal views but hopefully will give an insight for those new ( and not so new) to the concept of what to expect.\r\n\r\nTime fly\u2019s - It really does! If you want to get to play your game at the end of the 8 hours you need to have a time plan. This means working with your new team mates and deciding who does what, how long stuff takes and when it all needs to come together.\r\n\r\nToo many cooks - Having a load of artists / programmers / audio engineers is great for a project but if you are assembling a team on the day try and get a good balance of people. You can have the best programmed game in the world but if you are moving blocks around on screen its not that fun\u2026. ( Someone will probably prove me wrong on the day :-P )\r\n\r\nBattle Plan - Planning and discussing the game is important, the ideas that will sprout from all that energy and excitement will boggle the mind BUT try and keep it in perspective. You have 8 hours. Its WAY to easy to bite off more than you can chew. Try and realistically gauge the time requirement for a task or if in doubt round up time estimates.\r\n\r\nBoard Meeting - The last one of there\u2019s I was at a chap called Andrew brought a magic board, one of those that you can stick on the wall. It was great, everyone could see what was on the to-do and it could be updated in real time. Super handy!\r\n\r\nTools of the Trade - Know the tools you intend to use and have them ready. Its great fun to use new stuff but on such a small time frame its unwise to crack open Maya for the first time on the day, it just won\u2019t work the way you intend. Also having said tools already set up is super important as downloading an update for something on the day might not be possible. Internet may be available but with another 40 odd people trying to use it at the same time its going to be very slow if usable at all. Artists: If possible bring sounds ,texture samples along with you, u just never know if you can get access to fresh content.\r\n\r\nBreakfast like a King, Lunch like a Prince\u2026 - Easily over looked but getting some food and having a break is very important for the final evening stretch. Organise coffee breaks, you and the team will be better for it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any specific questions about doing a games jam, email Round Crisis and they\u2019ll pass the queries onto me :-)\r\n\r\nAbove all else enjoy the day and don\u2019t forget to say hello!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fr.twitter.com/CrazyEoin\">@CrazyEoin</a>",

    "content": "(NOTE: This is a ported post from tumblr)\r\n\r\nA big thanks to the judges.\r\n\r\n### Adam Renardson - [Siliconrepublic.com](http://Siliconrepublic.com)\r\nI am currently head of online and new media and Siliconrepublic.com and somehow found myself writing video game reviews for Siliconrepublic since arriving in 2009. I would profess to being a seasoned gamer with (un)fond memories of EGA graphics and 64kb RAM being \u201ctop of the range\u201d and blowing furiously into C64 cartridges in an attempt to prolong their gaming life. Outside of gaming I enjoy music, films and having my heart broken every season by Arsenal.\r\n\r\n### Dave McCabe\r\nDave McCabe is a film director, writer and script editor who has worked on more things than he\u2019d care to remember. He is currently studying an MSc in Film wherein his speciality is story and character development. The first video game he played was a version of \u2018Green Beret\u2019 that was so old he can\u2019t even find a copy on youtube\u2026\r\n\r\nOnline, he lives at\u00a0[davetheallthing.com](http://davetheallthing.com/).\r\n\r\n### Eoin Meagher\r\nEoin started off his gaming obsession with the mighty plastic grey box that was the Commodore 64. Years of torment from insanely difficult gaming lead him to the PC generation and he fell in love with games all over again. Having worked in GAME and computer hardware centers he went back to college to Carlow IT and got a degree in a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Games Development. Now a big fan of Unity3d he champions the indy cause, esp the IrishGameDev scene and will gladly talk for hours and hours about games, to any person who\u2019s not abe to escape\u2026. you have been warned!\r\n\r\n### Joseph Kehoe\r\nThe first computer games Joseph Kehoe played were on a Dragon 32 but that was in the previous millennium. He graduated from UCD with a BSc (Computer Science in 1990 and an MSc (AI) in 1993. Since then he have worked mainly in Education teaching at all levels from Certificate to MSc. He has worked in industry for a number of years but prefers the ivory tower that is education. Currently he lectures Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (amongst other things) in IT Carlow on the Computer Games Development BSc. In his spare time he is interested in scripting languages and parallel programming. Rumour has it that he is actually a cyborg and talks about himself in the third person.\r\n\r\n### Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby Biog\r\n[The Gaming Liberty](http://thegamingliberty.com/)\u00a0is an award winning founded by Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby in 2009. Two avid and enthusiastic gamers, they quickly established The Gaming Liberty as a credible, friendly and up-to-date gaming website.

So far the games are winning.\u00a0After finishing her MSc in Abertay, Dundee and competing in Dare to be Digital, she worked as a gameplay programmer on Prince Caspian at Traveller\u2019s Tales. She then moved to Lionhead Studios to work as a designer on Milo &amp; Kate and more recently on Fable: The Journey. Now back in Ireland, she\u2019s launching a serious games startup and is on the New Frontiers entrepreneur development programme. You can find her online [http://twitter.com/elaine_reynolds](@elaine_reynolds).\r\n\r\n### Rose Farrell\r\nI am an event manager with a keen interest in all things nerdy. I've been involved with Eirtakon, Ireland's largest anime convention for years and recently started to run GameJam events in Dublin. I've loved computer games ever since I first played Sonic the Hedgehog when I was 11. Having played all Fallout games, including Fallout Tactics, I feel fully prepared for a nuclear apocalypse. I absolutely love the GameJam concept and am constantly in awe of those that can design, write and build a game in such a short time. It's the people that can do that who will produce the next generation of amazing, time-eating, award winning games!\r\n\r\n### Bryan Duggan\r\nBryan Duggan is a lecturer at the Dublin Institute of Technology who has been teaching course on games technology (maths, physics &amp; programming) since\u00a0 2006. Bryan mentored several teams to success at the Imagine Cup and Games Fleadh and has been a Judge at the Imagine Cup Worldwide Finals (in New York), the Nokia Digital Media Awards and the Appys. In his spare time, Bryan plays traditional music on the flute and writes apps for traditional musicians.",

You can interpret these two images as you want and go from there.\r\nSo, for example, if we showed the colour blue and a picture of an elephant, you could make a game about a sad elephant or a game about the sorrow of the ivory trade or even a game featuring a blue spacecraft called \u2018Elephant\u2019.\r\n\r\nWe also urge you to include a twist element in your game. So if it is a story-based game then include a narrative twist, or maybe reverse the reward mechanisms or make an unusual pairing of setting and game mechanic. We don\u2019t know; surprise us.",

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for Belfast GameCraft! This time around, particpants, either individually or as a team, have a whole 8 hours to create a game centered around a random theme to be announced on the day.\r\nIt will be exciting, it will be intense, it will be\u2026slightly pungent, frankly. But it will be worth it! After 8 hours, a panel of highly trained judges (at least, they look highly trained, they are all wearing monacles) will examine each of the submitted games and select a few stand out entries to be awarded some awesome prizes. While the games are being pinched, prodded, and poked, we\u2019ll all have some well deserved refreshments and a bit of time for the all important networking. Participants are free to use whatever game creation platform they like, be that Unity, UDK, GameMaker, Construct2, XNA, or one of the myriad other fine platforms available today. Good luck and may the most ridiculous game win!\r\n\r\n<strong>What happens on the day?</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You with your team need to build a game from scratch, you have about 8 hours.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can come with a team formed or form your team there</li>\r\n\t<li>Platform agnostic</li>\r\n\t<li>We announce a topic during breakfast</li>\r\n\t<li>Early start, then, at 5pm judging starts. There is a people's choice so we all get to play each others games</li>\r\n\t<li>People and Judges vote .. there are prizes yay!</li>\r\n\t<li>Everyone learns</li>\r\n\t<li>People meet other people</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis event is <strong>free </strong>but all members of your team need a ticket ... <a title=\"Belfast Gamecraft\" href=\"http://belfastgamecraft.eventbrite.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>REGISTER</strong></a>\r\n\r\nAnd a big thanks to our judges, so be nice to them:-\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>John Geoffrey Newman (<a title=\"John Geoffrey Newman\" href=\"https://twitter.com/john_geoffrey\">@john_geoffrey</a>)</li>\r\n\t<li>Matt Johnston\u00a0(<a title=\"Matt Johnston\" href=\"https://twitter.com/cimota\">@cimota</a>)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n### Q. Any restrictions on who can join?\r\nAll levels welcome.\r\n\r\n### Q: How many people can be in a team?\r\nTeam size is unrestricted, although bear in mind that larger teams will make it hard work as well.\r\n\r\n### Q: Do we bring our own hardware?\r\nYes, participants will bring their own hardware, but you will need to look after your own hardware on the day.\r\n\r\n### Q. Does GameCraft support online participation?\r\nNo, but we will look into it for future Dublin Game Crafts.\r\n\r\n### Q. Do we decide on an idea before the event?\r\nThe topic of the game is decided on the day, so probably not a good idea.\r\n\r\n### Q. Can we also bring pre-written frameworks we code ourselves. Would we need to share these frameworks with the other teams?\r\nYou are free to use which ever framework you want. Sharing your own framework is up to you.\r\n\r\n### Q. What other tools and frameworks should bring along?\r\nPrepare your machine with the tools before you come along on the day, this will alleviate the load on the wifi. You can find information on what you need on this resources page.\r\n\r\n## Organisers\r\n* Andrea Magnorsky (@roundcrisis on twitter)\r\n* Matt Johnston (@cimota on twitter)\r\n* Greg Maguire\r\n* Andrew O\u2019Connor (@bravesirandrew on twitter)",

We'll need at least 14 people for it to make sense, but the more we get, the cheaper it'll be.\r\n\r\nIf we get enough people, we'll be GameCrafting in Belfast for the day, without the hassle of public transport! Nice.\r\n\r\n<h3>Please <strong><a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5394148042#\" target=\"_blank\">register here </a></strong>if you are interested</h3>\r\n\r\nPS Thanks to Shane for the hard work!",

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for another GameCraft . This time around, particpants, either individually or as a team, have a 7 hours to create a game centered around a random theme to be announced on the day. It will be exciting, it will be intense, it will be\u2026slightly pungent, frankly. But it will be worth it! After 7 hours, a panel of highly trained judges (at least, they look highly trained) will examine each of the submitted games and select a few stand out entries to be awarded some awesome prizes. While the games are being pinched, prodded, and poked, we\u2019ll all have some time for the all important networking. Participants are free to use whatever game creation platform they like, be that Unity, UDK, GameMaker, Construct2, XNA, or one of the myriad other fine platforms available today. Good luck and may the most ridiculous game win!\r\n\r\nWhat happens on the day?\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You with your team need to build a game from scratch, you have about 7 hours.</li>\r\n\t<li>You can come with a team formed or form your team there</li>\r\n\t<li>Platform agnostic</li>\r\n\t<li>We select a topic during at the begining of the event</li>\r\n\t<li>Start at 11am, then, at the end of the day (6pm ) all the games are be demoed</li>\r\n\t<li>Judges vote .. there are prizes yay!</li>\r\n\t<li>Everyone learns</li>\r\n\t<li>People meet other people</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou can get your ticket via the following link to Games Fleadh:\u00a0<a title=\"Games Fleadh - GameCraft - Get tickets here\" href=\"http://www.gamesfleadh.ie/gamecraft/\">http://www.gamesfleadh.ie/gamecraft/</a>",

If not, you might have died! One hopes you're still reading...and if you are, one also hopes that you'll be able to show up for Dublin GameCraft 3 this <strong>May the 18th</strong>! That's a Saturday so I won't hear any excuses!\r\n\r\nYou probably know the drill by now, but just in case, this will be a twelve hour game jam event. For any who don't know, in a game jam, you create a small game in a limited amount of time, either on your own or as a team. You can use whatever platform/tools/ gamedev voodoo you like, and it will be held in a place called <a title=\"Engine Yard (Dublin)\" href=\"https://www.engineyard.com/\">Engine Yard</a> In Barrow Street, Dublin 2 (<a href=\"http://goo.gl/maps/O58P1\" target=\"_blank\">Map</a>). Show up before 9am to get yourself set up, and at 9am on the dot, we'll announce the theme, followed by an explosive outpouring of creative energies for a solid twelve hours! Afterwards, our panel of specially trained minion judges will poke at your game for a few hours, and then declare themselves winners! This of course is not the desired outcome, so we'll get them to pick the best games to receive a few prizes instead. During this time, it's important that you be merry, drink some beers, and network with your fellow game devs.\r\n\r\n<h3>TICKETS</h3>\r\n<strong>Why are we charging for Dublin GameCraft?</strong>\r\nThis allows us to try and minimize the number of people ordering tickets and not turning up or turning up without ordering tickets. Essentially we can run a smoother event. The money collected via the tickets will go towards pizza in the evening.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot see the ticket page below, please purchase your ticket(s) via <a href=\"https://tito.io/gamecraft/dublin-gamecraft-3\">https://tito.io/gamecraft/dublin-gamecraft-3</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://engineyard.com\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-153\" title=\"Engine Yard Dublin\" src=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/engine_yard_logo-183x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"165\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://tito.ie\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Stz0PsD.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Gold</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bigfishgames.com/company/open-positions.html\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ReH7mvh.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://dit.ie\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/suycjmL.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.havok.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/V7mYzmv.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://gamesireland.ie/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JJQo5cE.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://swrve.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uCZnShC.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Silver</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://arcadecon.ie/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OS5UQSL.png\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gamesparks.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/x5MBrws.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.intercom.io/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bWS9rWg.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zoodazzle.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iYbBA1n.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Indie</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://studiopowwow.com\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jFrthTl.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Prizes</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://gamestop.ie\"><img src=\"http://www.python.ie/static/images/sponsors/main_logos/gamestop.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5GZiO6G.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://xamarin.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AJ4wWPc.png\" alt=\"Xamarin\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://oreilly.com/\"><img src=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oreilly_160.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.qwertee.com/\"><img src=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Qwertee-small.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Thanks</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://batcatgames.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fBKGyQ9.jpg\" alt=\"BatCat Games\" /></a>",

    "content": "<strong>(Tues, July 30th - Derry-Londonderry)</strong> Dublin-based games development event, GameCraft , have announced a special twenty-four hour game jam with Nintendo on September 13th-14th as part of this year\u2019s CultureTECH Festival in Derry-Londonderry.\r\n\r\nThe event will see over 100 games developers from across the UK and Ireland compete, from 7pm on Friday night to 7pm on Saturday night, to develop new video games centred around a theme to be announced on the day.\r\n\r\nThe involvement of Nintendo marks a unique opportunity for all participants. Developers have the chance to create a game for the Wii U console, with exclusive access to development hardware and using the new Nintendo Web Framework. Nintendo will provide hands-on technical support and internal game evaluation staff of the company will participate in the jury.\r\n<blockquote><em>Nintendo Web Framework makes Wii U more accessible for developers, as you can create Wii U software only using HTML5 and JavaScript. I believe it is a rather interesting environment for a 24-hour game jam</em>\u201d, says Martin Buchholz, Manager of Nintendo\u2019s Developer Relations &amp; Support in Europe. Martin adds \u201c<em>CultureTECH is going to be an amazing festival and we are proud to take part in this special event.</em></blockquote>\r\nThe event builds on the recent success of GameCraft, which aims to help \u201c<em>game-makers to meet, share ideas, have fun, compete for prizes and most importantly make games!</em>\u201d Since launching in Dublin in 2012, with over 120 attendees producing more than 35 games, GameCraft has hosted events across Ireland with new events now planned for New York and London.\r\n\r\nCultureTECH Festival Director, Mark Nagurski added:\r\n<blockquote>\u00a0\u201c<em>Not only are we thrilled to welcome GameCraft to Derry for the first time, but having Nintendo involved is a real coup for the festival. We have a really strong games programme at this year\u2019s CultureTECH with workshops, tournaments and free-to-play arcades throughout the city but this announcement really puts it over the top. We also need to say a special thank you to Invest Northern Ireland for making the initial introductions which have led directly to this collaboration.</em>\u201d</blockquote>\r\nAnyone interested in taking part in GameCraft at CultureTECH can register online at <a title=\"Derry GameCraft @ CultureTECH\" href=\"http://globalgamecraft.com/events/derry-gamecraft/\">http://globalgamecraft.com/events/derry-gamecraft/</a>.

What you may not know is that Nintendo is participating in this one.

You should totally check it out ahead of time, because it really is quite cool. It honestly couldn't be better if he'd called it PunchInTheFaceJS!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDidn't sign up yet?

Starting as Games Tester for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (Nintendo 64) in 1998, he now is responsible for game evaluation and software strategy as well as the technical certification group. He is 38, married and father of two children.\r\n\r\n<h3>Nic Magnier</h3>\r\nNic Magnier is a Senior Product Analyst at Nintendo of Europe where he evaluates titles in development on Wii U and Nintendo 3DS and gives feedback to developers. Before joining Nintendo in 2006, Nic worked in game development as a programmer and game designer. He got the programming bug when moving a turtle on his Thomson TO8D monitor for the first time in 1986. Over the years, as he was spending more time playing games on his Game Boy than programming, he decided that one day he will work in the games industry.\r\n\r\n<h3>Oliver Burkietowicz</h3>\r\nOliver is a Senior Network Business Specialist at Nintendo of Europe. He started his gaming career as a Decathlon and River Raid addict at the age of five. At some point he turned pro gamer and ran a gaming news site, which eventually led to proper jobs such as a community manager or producing gaming clips for TV. After going to Uni for a second time to study Japanese, he finally joined Nintendo of Europe in 2008. At Nintendo, Oliver was responsible for planning the digital releases across their various platforms for years. Nowadays, he works on the company\u2019s digital strategy, including Nintendo eShop and its business policies, aiming to make it a better place for all developers.\r\n\r\n<h3>Andrea Magnorsky</h3>\r\nAndrea is a professional software developer and has accrued many years of experience building applications. After a long life in the entreprise development world she is now developing games and the proud co-founder of <a href=\"http://batcatgames.com\">BatCat Games</a>. Andrea is involved in the organisation of <a title=\"Mono for Android\u2013Beyond getting\u00a0started\" href=\"http://dublingamecraft.com\">GameCraft</a>, <a href=\"http://dublinalt.net\" target=\"_blank\">Alt Net in Dublin</a>\u00a0and other code related communities in Ireland.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"BatCat Games\" href=\"https://twitter.com/batcatgames\">@batcatgames</a> | <a title=\"BatCat Games website\" href=\"http://batcatgames.com\">http://batcatgames.com</a>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dave McCabe</h3>\r\nDave McCabe is a filmmaker, video game narrative designer and all around writer sort who has worked on more things than he\u2019d care to remember. He\u2019d give you a list, but it would just depress him when you\u2019d heard of none of it. He has been playing video games since he couldn\u2019t get past the first boss of an early 80\u2032s version of \u2018Green Beret\u2019 that is so old he can\u2019t even find a video for it on youtube. You can find him on twitter\u00a0<a href=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/category/judges-2/twitter.com/davetheallthing\">@davetheallthing</a>\u00a0where he\u2019ll probably say something about your ma.\r\n",
