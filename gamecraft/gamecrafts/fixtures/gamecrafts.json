I would profess to being a seasoned gamer with (un)fond memories of EGA graphics and 64kb RAM being \u201ctop of the range\u201d and blowing furiously into C64 cartridges in an attempt to prolong their gaming life. Outside of gaming I enjoy music, films and having my heart broken every season by Arsenal.\r\n\r\n## Dave McCabe\r\n\r\nDave McCabe is a film director, writer and script editor who has worked on more things than he\u2019d care to remember. He is currently studying an MSc in Film wherein his speciality is story and character development. The first video game he played was a version of \u2018Green Beret\u2019 that was so old he can\u2019t even find a copy on youtube\u2026\r\n\r\nOnline, he lives at davetheallthing.com.\r\n\r\n## Eoin Meagher\r\n\r\nEoin started off his gaming obsession with the mighty plastic grey box that was the Commodore 64. Years of torment from insanely difficult gaming lead him to the PC generation and he fell in love with games all over again. Having worked in GAME and computer hardware centers he went back to college to Carlow IT and got a degree in a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Games Development. Now a big fan of Unity3d he champions the indy cause, esp the IrishGameDev scene and will gladly talk for hours and hours about games, to any person who\u2019s not abe to escape\u2026. you have been warned!\r\n\r\n## Joseph Kehoe\r\n\r\nThe first computer games Joseph Kehoe played were on a Dragon 32 but that was in the previous millennium. He graduated from UCD with a BSc (Computer Science in 1990 and an MSc (AI) in 1993. Since then he have worked mainly in Education teaching at all levels from Certificate to MSc. He has worked in industry for a number of years but prefers the ivory tower that is education. Currently he lectures Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (amongst other things) in IT Carlow on the Computer Games Development BSc. In his spare time he is interested in scripting languages and parallel programming. Rumour has it that he is actually a cyborg and talks about himself in the third person.\r\n\r\n## Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby Biog\r\n\r\nThe Gaming Liberty is an award winning founded by Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby in 2009. Two avid and enthusiastic gamers, they quickly established The Gaming Liberty as a credible, friendly and up-to-date gaming website.

We hope to get to all your games, but will endeavour to get at least three of us to play every game.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll judge your game on the criteria listed below, score it out of 50 and then reconvene to discuss and average our scores to give your game its final result.\r\n\r\nWe aim to have this done by 11pm, when we will announce the top three games and any honourable mentions before giving out prizes and whatnot.\r\n\r\nJudges notes and game scores will not be released.\r\n\r\n### CRITERIA\r\n\r\nYour game will be judged on the following criteria:\r\n\r\n- Gameplay (mechanics, design, etc)\r\n- Art (graphics, audio)\r\n- Technology (programming, platforms, technical innovation)\r\n- Idea (a measure of how well you implement the theme, story, that kinda stuff)\r\n- How complete the game you make is (a fully functional game and polish such as menus, start screens, cut-scenes, etc )",

That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time for Belfast GameCraft!

But it will be worth it! After 8 hours, a panel of highly trained judges (at least, they look highly trained, they are all wearing monacles) will examine each of the submitted games and select a few stand out entries to be awarded some awesome prizes. While the games are being pinched, prodded, and poked, we\u2019ll all have some well deserved refreshments and a bit of time for the all important networking. Participants are free to use whatever game creation platform they like, be that Unity, UDK, GameMaker, Construct2, XNA, or one of the myriad other fine platforms available today. Good luck and may the most ridiculous game win!\r\n\r\n# What happens on the day?\r\n\r\n* You with your team need to build a game from scratch, you have about 8 hours.\r\n* You can come with a team formed or form your team there\r\n* Platform agnostic\r\n* We announce a topic during breakfast\r\n* Early start, then, at 5pm judging starts. There is a people\u2019s choice so we all get to play each others games\r\n* People and Judges vote .. there are prizes yay!\r\n* Everyone learns\r\n* People meet other people\r\n\r\nThis event is free but all members of your team need a ticket.\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n### Q. Any restrictions on who can join?\r\nAll levels welcome.\r\n\r\n### Q: How many people can be in a team?\r\nTeam size is unrestricted, although bear in mind that larger teams will make it hard work as well.\r\n\r\n### Q: Do we bring our own hardware?\r\nYes, participants will bring their own hardware, but you will need to look after your own hardware on the day.\r\n\r\n### Q. Does GameCraft support online participation?\r\nNo, but we will look into it for future Dublin Game Crafts.\r\n\r\n### Q. Do we decide on an idea before the event?\r\nThe topic of the game is decided on the day, so probably not a good idea.\r\n\r\n### Q. Can we also bring pre-written frameworks we code ourselves. Would we need to share these frameworks with the other teams?\r\nYou are free to use which ever framework you want. Sharing your own framework is up to you.\r\n\r\n### Q. What other tools and frameworks should bring along?\r\nPrepare your machine with the tools before you come along on the day, this will alleviate the load on the wifi.

Afterwards, our panel of specially trained minion judges will poke at your game for a few hours, and then declare themselves winners! This of course is not the desired outcome, so we\u2019ll get them to pick the best games to receive a few prizes instead. During this time, it\u2019s important that you be merry, drink some beers, and network with your fellow game devs.\r\n\r\n#TICKETS\r\n### Why are we charging for Dublin GameCraft?\r\nThis allows us to try and minimize the number of people ordering tickets and not turning up or turning up without ordering tickets. Essentially we can run a smoother event. The money collected via the tickets will go towards pizza in the evening.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://engineyard.com\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-153\" title=\"Engine Yard Dublin\" src=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/engine_yard_logo-183x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"165\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://tito.ie\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Stz0PsD.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Gold</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bigfishgames.com/company/open-positions.html\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ReH7mvh.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://dit.ie\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/suycjmL.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.havok.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/V7mYzmv.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://gamesireland.ie/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JJQo5cE.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://swrve.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/uCZnShC.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Silver</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://arcadecon.ie/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OS5UQSL.png\"></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.gamesparks.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/x5MBrws.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.intercom.io/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bWS9rWg.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zoodazzle.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/iYbBA1n.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Indie</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://studiopowwow.com\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jFrthTl.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Prizes</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://gamestop.ie\"><img src=\"http://www.python.ie/static/images/sponsors/main_logos/gamestop.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/5GZiO6G.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://xamarin.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AJ4wWPc.png\" alt=\"Xamarin\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://oreilly.com/\"><img src=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oreilly_160.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.qwertee.com/\"><img src=\"http://dublingamecraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Qwertee-small.png\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n<h4>Thanks</h4>\r\n<a href=\"http://batcatgames.com/\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fBKGyQ9.jpg\" alt=\"BatCat Games\" /></a>",

He started his gaming career as a Decathlon and River Raid addict at the age of five. At some point he turned pro gamer and ran a gaming news site, which eventually led to proper jobs such as a community manager or producing gaming clips for TV. After going to Uni for a second time to study Japanese, he finally joined Nintendo of Europe in 2008. At Nintendo, Oliver was responsible for planning the digital releases across their various platforms for years.
