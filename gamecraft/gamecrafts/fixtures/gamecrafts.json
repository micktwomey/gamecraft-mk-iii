Development teams can be pre-determined or decided on the day (although the latter will eat into development time). There\u2019s even a little Google group for people to meet up and make teams. You\u2019ll be pleased to hear that you can use whatever game building tools you like (Unity/GameMaker/UDK etc), and target whatever platform you\u2019re most familiar with (Windows/iPad/Xbox).\r\n\r\n# SPONSORS\r\n\r\n## Our host:\r\n<p><img title=\"DIT\" src=\"http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzqwzn6MOc1r67s55o1_250.jpg\" alt=\"DIT\" /></p>\r\n\r\n## Sponsored by:\r\n<p><img title=\"Demonware\" src=\"http://python.ie/static/images/sponsors/main_logos/demonware.png\" alt=\"Demonware\" /><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6499601165_7bca222999_z.jpg\" title=\"Open Emotion\" alt=\"Open Emotion\"/><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/img/logos/logo_jetbrains.gif\" alt=\"JetBrains\" title=\"JetBrains\"/><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://slodive.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mascot-designs/swrve.jpg\" alt=\"Swrve\" title=\"Swrve\"/><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://xamarin.com/resources/design/site-id-light.png\" alt=\"Xamarin\" title=\"Xamarin\"/><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://python.ie/static/images/sponsors/main_logos/microsoft.png\" title=\"Microsoft\" alt=\"Microsoft\"/></p>\r\n\r\n## Lunch provided by\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.sweetcicely.ie/xfiles/images/sweetcicelylogo.gif\" title=\"Sweet Cicely\" alt=\"Sweet Cicely\"/></p>",

I would profess to being a seasoned gamer with (un)fond memories of EGA graphics and 64kb RAM being \u201ctop of the range\u201d and blowing furiously into C64 cartridges in an attempt to prolong their gaming life. Outside of gaming I enjoy music, films and having my heart broken every season by Arsenal.\r\n\r\n## Dave McCabe\r\n\r\nDave McCabe is a film director, writer and script editor who has worked on more things than he\u2019d care to remember. He is currently studying an MSc in Film wherein his speciality is story and character development. The first video game he played was a version of \u2018Green Beret\u2019 that was so old he can\u2019t even find a copy on youtube\u2026\r\n\r\nOnline, he lives at davetheallthing.com.\r\n\r\n## Eoin Meagher\r\n\r\nEoin started off his gaming obsession with the mighty plastic grey box that was the Commodore 64. Years of torment from insanely difficult gaming lead him to the PC generation and he fell in love with games all over again. Having worked in GAME and computer hardware centers he went back to college to Carlow IT and got a degree in a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Games Development. Now a big fan of Unity3d he champions the indy cause, esp the IrishGameDev scene and will gladly talk for hours and hours about games, to any person who\u2019s not abe to escape\u2026. you have been warned!\r\n\r\n## Joseph Kehoe\r\n\r\nThe first computer games Joseph Kehoe played were on a Dragon 32 but that was in the previous millennium. He graduated from UCD with a BSc (Computer Science in 1990 and an MSc (AI) in 1993. Since then he have worked mainly in Education teaching at all levels from Certificate to MSc. He has worked in industry for a number of years but prefers the ivory tower that is education. Currently he lectures Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence (amongst other things) in IT Carlow on the Computer Games Development BSc. In his spare time he is interested in scripting languages and parallel programming. Rumour has it that he is actually a cyborg and talks about himself in the third person.\r\n\r\n## Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby Biog\r\n\r\nThe Gaming Liberty is an award winning founded by Joseph Murphy and Shane Willoughby in 2009. Two avid and enthusiastic gamers, they quickly established The Gaming Liberty as a credible, friendly and up-to-date gaming website. Covering as many facets of news as possible, TGL also aims to bring original and unique content to our readership.\r\n",

We hope to get to all your games, but will endeavour to get at least three of us to play every game.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll judge your game on the criteria listed below, score it out of 50 and then reconvene to discuss and average our scores to give your game its final result.\r\n\r\nWe aim to have this done by 11pm, when we will announce the top three games and any honourable mentions before giving out prizes and whatnot.\r\n\r\nJudges notes and game scores will not be released.\r\n\r\n### CRITERIA\r\n\r\nYour game will be judged on the following criteria:\r\n\r\n- Gameplay (mechanics, design, etc)\r\n- Art (graphics, audio)\r\n- Technology (programming, platforms, technical innovation)\r\n- Idea (a measure of how well you implement the theme, story, that kinda stuff)\r\n- How complete the game you make is (a fully functional game and polish such as menus, start screens, cut-scenes, etc )",
