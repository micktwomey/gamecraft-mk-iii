<h1>Thanks to Everyone Who Makes GameCraft a Success</h1>
<p>GameCraft events wouldn't be possible without the help of volunteers, venues, participants and sponsors.</p>

<h1>Sponsors</h1>
<p>GameCraft couldn't possibly run as many events as we do without the generous aid of the following sponsors.</p>
