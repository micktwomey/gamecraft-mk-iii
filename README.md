# GameCraft Site MK III

Written in Django. Why? Lots of plugins and docs.

Why not flask? Less plugins and seems to have stalled somewhat.

## Hosting

The plan is to run as docker images on a super cheat (tm) Digital Ocean VM. With luck and smart caching we can run for $5 a month!

## Development

The other reason to use Docker is it makes it easier to get going with a Vagrant VM which more closely apes the real site.
